"1","Review: 41 : Amazon Echo - Black","null",0,"Amazon Review","Tue Oct 18 00:00:00 EDT 2016","18-Oct-16","null","Amazon Echo - Black","null","I ordered Echo specifically for musicIve had a huge music library on Amazon for years But it didnt take long after installing Echo to find out that there is now an annual charge for having oversongs so only a small portion of my library is available But OKsince subscription is to be expected these days I decided to pare down my library down to fit and get Echo to play only the songs that are free But I found Alexa will not play them When I ask to play something from my music library it plays unfamiliar songs that I know are not in there If I ask for one of my playlists instead more often than not shell just start playing crappy Prime music When that happens I just keep saying Alexa next until maybetunes later it produces something I can actually tolerate Anotheror so crappy tunes and my blood pressure is rising so I figure its too much work to listen to any more music on Echo I say Alexa stop When I ask for a specific song I might get it to play because its actually in Prime Ive been a Prime shipping member since the beginning But more often I will get a pitch for the Unlimited music atper month and a short sample of the song I wanted to hear to try to upsell me to an expensive service I dont want Ive found that all of the Prime services are quite limited not only Music but Video and Books Its especially hard to find anything of any real value in Booksmostly its stupid romances and mysteries Video has a similar low ratio of classics to dreck Now Ive discovered the same problem exists in Prime Music And compared to Prime services Google Play and Google Search are a pleasure They have enough good content that I use them at work constantly I was expecting something similar for my home from Amazon But back to Echo Another battle I had with Alexa was that I assumed she could hear me at all Its quiet in my small house and my office is just down the hall from her but often I got no response to my voice commands So I figured Ill try using the Fire TV remote device to feed in my commands directly I bought Fire TV initially because of the suggestion somewhere on the web site that it would work with Echo which I planned to buy later I dont particularly like Fire TV but at least it wasnt expensive I could see from the Alexa app how to do the pairing but had no luck so I called Support After a while I was told I have to unpair it for TV and set it to work for the Echo instead so we spent about an hour trying to do that over and over without success I wouldnt mind switching pairing back and forth if it would work so I gave it my best shot Finally I got escalated to the Echo team and learned from that team member that the Fire TV remote will never work Instead I have to buy a remote that is specifically for Echo Already I wasted hours on several support calls trying to get Echo to play my music library then another hour trying to get the Fire TV remote to work and finally I learned it would cost me anotherto get Alexa to hear me if Im in my office only aboutfeet away What a waste for something that shouldnt be necessary in the first place As for troubleshooting the music library several very nice Support team members tried to help me get it to upload I first got a rep who says shed give me a day trial to verify that it would work before I subscribed So I spent a couple of days editing my copy of my library on an extended drive so I could try dragging them into Amazons Musics desktop app to upload them But then the upload from my desktop would not work Instead I got an email that the trial had already expiredin two days instead of thirty Another rep tried to get the trial going but I got another twoday expiration I do have other things to do so I wasnt working on it during those two days So again uploading my meager library did not work I even got a third expired trial but by then I was past caring Actually all of the support reps are very earnest charming polite and accommodating but they seem to have a very small knowledge base to work with There is no documentation available to them much less customers so they have to guess thats probably why it took forever to find out the Fire TV remote wouldnt work The day trials didnt work either but it made sense that there would be a way to accommodate customers who do want to give it a chance before investing heavily in the necessary upsells I guess upper management didnt think of that As noted by other Echo reviewers the bugs are apparently not yet worked out and it seems to me that the support process has apparently been defined only for gardenvariety issues I get the feeling that this product was just released too early and the customer service process was not coordinated with the release to deal with the inevitable problems customers would have with Echo I hope Amazon will learn from this review and fix these problems for others but its too late for me While going through all of these remarkable hassles I was constantly reevaluating my commitment to this device I was deciding whether to spend up tofor what is essentially just a voiceactivated speakerplusfor the subscriptionfor an additional remote But the other services are marginal at best As in the other reviews here I found that Alexa knows practically nothing Bing search engine so getting questions answered successfully is rare Alexa does set a timer and reports the weather competently but I have an iPhone so why would I care about those small conveniences All I really wanted was voiceactivated music If I ever had gotten my library in there on a trial basis Id probably have gone ahead and used it maybe even paid for a subscription though certainly not Unlimited music But Amazons trial software doesnt work yet to show me that my music library would ever work so why should I keep banging my head on the wall trying force Echo to work as advertised Recently I learned that Google is releasing a competitive device in a couple of weeks and the online review says I can easily upload my music library to it and use Google Play and Search instead Plus its going to be about half the price of Echo and considering all the upsells needed to make Echo work it seems like a nobrainer to just give up on Alexa and Echo So sorry Amazon I love youIm one of your oldest customers and have probably spent overon your site sinceBut this product has become a paperweight that I dont even try to use anymore Im sorry to say that its time to throw in the towel and just send it back","null","null",NA,"null","positive"

to and in this area as well Alexa over delivers We were in the market for a new general use sound system already and in that respect Echo does not disappoint Besides the buyers high when first unpacking my new toy the packaging is Amazons standard amazing fare the first thing we noted after getting her up and running was the excellent sound quality Echo has a greater range than expected assuming you are reasonable and compare it to say a counter top CD player and not a shelf system I look forward to Amazon coming out with a wireless subwoofer to pair with it to boost the range even further Ahem AmazonIts already clear to me that this is gamechanging technology Forgiving the learning curve that all voice recognition software is still going through being able to tell your furniture what you want and having it obey is pretty amazing It first dawned on me what a difference this will make when after less thanhours I was in the car running errands and actually found it inconvenient that I had to find the song on a CD I was looking for using my hands I know rightI poured over articles on the Echo prior to it shippingsidebar kudos to Amazon for how this product was launched brilliant marketing psychologyand much has been said comparing Echo to assistant offerings from Apple Google and Microsoft I agree with the assessment of some that to have this functionality native to your home environment and not tethered to a device is a major positive leap Amazon has done something very very right by being first major retailer to marketEcho is a nobrainer purchase if you have Prime Without Prime the initial launch capabilities are quite a bit more limited That said theres no sensible reason not to have Prime because Prime members save a hundred bucks on the Echo current as of writing anyway and Prime is a hundred bucks So youd pay the same for Echo and Prime as you would Echo without Prime Amazon is taking all the right logical steps while launching this product To expound on Prime functionality the gimmicks of asking Echo about time weather jokes shopping lists etc are fairly useful but Echo isnt yet able to pull freeform answers from the web You can ask her to define or describe something from Wikipedia but ask her a question that would require contextual understanding and you get nowhere Thats not a failing on Amazons part were on our way to the future not there yet Im excited for all this to come but at this stage the greatest benefit of Echo at least for us is being able to play our Prime music on command Remember beyond whats on Prime you can upload your own music to the Amazon Cloud and put your normal playlist at your beck and callliterally Enhancements and features Id fully expect to see in the nearish futureVoice Profilingrecognition and variable permissions by individual profileour year old would have orderedlaptops and one new laptop within the first hour of us having the Echo if purchasing were turned on As nearly every article suggested its clear that Amazon is creating a new kind of storefront with this product Profiling as a safeguard is an extremely logical enhancementSatellite Unitshaving one unit in a open space is great but before long Echo will no doubt offer satellites in different spaces capable of separate operation but with the benefits of a central control system Like some of todays wholehome sound systems but with the power of voice operation and Cloudconnection to blow the doors wide on whats possibleContextual Informationthe future all of us expect when our innate computer system can answer our farreaching questions in the context we intend themHumorId be shocked if someone at Amazon isnt pouring over the data on what people are asking their Echoes to figure out what sorts of humorous Easter eggs they should load into it Ask yours Alexa open pod bay doors Hey Amazon give everyone in the office an extra freeminutes a day to come up with this kind of wacky stuff Its how we show off our new toys and impress our guests into wanting onePeripheral Speakerslike satellite units but with the intent to expand the audio capability Subwoofer etcAudiblecomno doubt coming very soon is the ability to play audiblecom books and hopefully rival formats at some point too I dont even own a single audio book but this is so obvious a function I have to believe it was one of the last things to hit the cutting room floor at Amazon when they were figuring out what capability they could launch withFull Amazon Universealong with audiblecom theres no reason not to expect full integration with Amazons universe of products and businesses Eg Fire TV already breached voice search that control should go native and untether itself from a remote very quickly nowControl of Other FunctionsEcho is a simple step toward voice control over other household functions thermostat lighting locks etc that are already fast finding themselves a part of the internet of things Im smitten with this thing and I could go on but I wont If you havent already purchased an Echo you might be thinking of waiting until some of these other functions exist or the voicerecognition system has matured If you have theto spend though I would urge you not to wait Be part of the early user base that Echo consistently improves itself on and watch with excitement as the new features roll in over the coming months I seriously doubt youll regret it This thing is already amazing Thumbs up for the product price and thumbs up to you If this review helped please thumbs

of mine has been raving about Alexa and for the longest time I couldnt figure out why Id have one I like gadgets but this is quite an expensive one if you dont know how youll use it I have several laptops tablets smart phonesdid I really need Alexa In fact I did and I do and heres why ProsMy kids can ask Alexa how to spell words Granted sometimes she mishears words But aboutof the time she gets it right Mom how do I spell castle Ask AlexaShe can play music from Prime stations Prime music and your music library This is actually so nice because right when my hands are full of whatever Im making for dinner its great to say Alexa play some s musicShe has a pleasant voice and speaks fluentlyShe has good sense of humor programmed in My kid asked her to selfdestruct and she answered Commencing selfdestruct sequenceBOOM Well that didnt go as plannedShe can tell you jokesShe can read books from Audible or books from Amazon prime that are enabled for narration The Audible books are read in the original voice and the Amazon prime books she reads in her voicea bit monotonous but not bad when youre tired of reading yet another Minecraft novel to your kidsShe can tell you the forecast or the current weather in various locationsShe can tell you entries from WikipediaShe can add things to your shopping list or your to do listSKILLS There are lots of skills you can enable through the Alexa applike the ability to translate to Spanishits not perfect but its a good startshes always learning and Amazon is adding new features Just now my kids were asking her if she has hands and she answered that she has no body Ask her if she has babies and she says she doesnt have a family but has friends Ask her who her friends are and she says lots of people talk to her And the best she knows therules of robots Consyes there are some consmost important one is that she wont connect to my Instant Pot Smart and cook my supper Things I wish shed doConnect to Overdrive Yes you can play Overdrive audio books and if you dont know what Overdrive is its an appsite for managing library ebooks or audiobooksmeaning free if your library supports Overdrive and has an ebookaudiobook collection on Alexa but she is then just functioning as just a bluetooth speaker you cant tell her to read a certain book and you need to involve another deviceConnect to the Instant Pot Smart Yes I also mentioned this as a con in jest If you dont know what an Instant Pot is its an electric pressure cooker and the Smart model comes with bluetooth I want to be able to control it via AlexaShe should be able to do more AI When shes confused she typically says Hmm I dont know how to help you with that or I dont understand your question You should be able to tell her a more Alexa style command then so she can associate theways of saying somethingI can only control one to do list and one shopping list I use Google Keep for my lists and Outlook for my calendar And my husband and I share a google account in addition so that we can keep joint lists in Keep She should be able to interface with that I think this is a major handicap I realize Amazon wants you to use everything Amazonbut this is why PCs became better than Apple computers You cant be an isolationist People dont want to switch over all their apps to Amazon supported onesAmazon has my profile whos in my family Every person in my family except theyear old has a Fitbit and yet Alexa can only tell me the status of mine as shes connected to my accountI should be able to create a todo list for my husband This is a major flaw If my husband is on my Amazon family profile I need to be able to create items for him As in Alexa put fix faucet on my husbands todo list Seriously this is supposed to be be a family gadget so why can I only create one todo list Very primitiveThe Alexa app is a pain to use in the store to actually use my shopping list There areorsteps to get into it Google Keep is much better I enjoy being able to tell her what to add but then retrieving that data isnt convenientShe needs to get an urban dictionary Or the ability to use other dictionarieslike one for Minecraft For when my kid wants to know how to spell HerobrineI wish there was a way to get her to recognize my voice so that she woudnt do my kids homework Why bother figuring out long division if you can just say Alexa what isdivided byI wish you could tell her to look something up Alexa google how to craft a diamond sword in MinecraftI get the urge to talk to Alexa via my phone in the storeAlexa show me my shopping list and then realize woe is meAlexa isnt with me What Im really excited aboutSKILLSyes I mentioned this before But Im not only excited about skills that other people create Im excited about skills I

"148","Review: 80 : Amazon Echo - Black","null",0,"Amazon Review","Fri Aug 14 00:00:00 EDT 2015","14-Aug-15","null","Amazon Echo - Black","null","This review was written within one week of receiving the Echo Ill update and extend this review soon What you get is really two pieces The first is Echo the hardware It is intentionally simple so as to not require software updates The second piece is Alexa a cloudbased voice interface service As the two are flexibly linked the Alexa service could also become available on other devices such as cell phones tablets and other smart Internet connected hardware that have microphones and speakers However for now the Alexa functionality seems targeted to the role that the Echo can play in your daytoday life However the converse is not true the Echo hardware can only work with the Alexa service Although Echo can respond when the Internet connection is interrupted it becomes as dumb and useful as a rock The reason I shelled out for the Echo is the API Amazon is clearly hoping to create a developer ecosystem for the cloud side of this device which is built around one of the least known and used services of AWS Lambda Thats as technical as Ill get The bottom line is that owners of this device can expect the features offered to mushroom all without having to update their Echo The updates will occur in the cloud and become instantly available The echo itself is essentially a cloudconnected speaker and microphone Its meant to be a piece of furniture that doesnt move You set it up at a central location in your home plug it in and forget about it It has sufficient volume to fill a room but its not a replacement for your kickass sound system and wasnt intended to be Its technically possible by writing software for the Echo to control that kickass sound system though should it have remote control capability This is unrelated to its ability to function as master control for your home automation gear for controlling lights appliances and garage door Impressively Alexa was able to play my favorite Internet radio station outofthebox with no configuration Alexa play tunein station Radio InfoWebThe syntax is a bit inhuman but is understandable by both humans and Alexa By comparison Alexa play Radio InfoWeb works sometimes for this particular station The keyword station undocumented disambiguates the name of the radio station Next why that could vary from station name to station name At present Alexa is tied to the limits of its syntax and natural language parser This can and has improved with more development on Amazons part In the meantime the syntax creates a limited namespace A bad development could be if Amazon plans to exploit or monetize that real estate They are certainly positioned to do that Thats the kind of anticompetitive force that could limit Alexas capability rather than expand it The syntax is lefttoright in terms of increasing specificity All commands start with the wake up word followed by an action for which there may be synonyms followed by the name of the skill provider which will likely be thirdparty These just popped up on the app a few days ago trumpeted as Alexas first new third party skills Alexa launch Crystal Ball is not particularly natural syntax but allows you to play magicball with Alexa Alexa open math puzzles is again not terribly natural syntax but the puzzles might keep the kids busy if you threaten them right Alexa ask StubHub whats happening this weekendthis uses Alexas published syntax where ask means pass the rest of the request on to a third party provider StubHub didnt know of anything going on in the major city I live in Room for improvement by StubHubbut you get the point There will likely be an endless stream of apps some of which may be useful as with iOS and Android On the other hand Google failed to find the killer app for Google Glass in this manner However Alexa doesnt need a killer app to be worth buying in my opinion and its th the price of Google Glass Echo is a cross between computer in Star Trek and an awesome voicecontrolled Internet radio Other reviews enthuse about the details there so Ill stop Amazon has clearly staked out some territory for its own future expansion If you ask it for the location of a restaurant for example Alexa replies Business information is not yet available hinting that it will be soon Alexa whats the number for the Foobar Restaurant in Lower Slobbovia Yes the Echo is potentially invasive of your security One has to trust Amazon and theres not much reason to do so based on history There is some transparency in the sense that Echos recordings of your voice and sound environment are immediately available on the app So you can hear whatever Amazon and of course the NSA have heard However there is currently no way to delete this history allatonce Something Google for example provides for You have to delete the card associated with each command oneatatime A real pain if you use Alexa a lot Tat doesnt delete your voice recording history Presumably this will be fixed real soon now once the NSA has perfected snatching their copy and storing it on AWS storage at taxpayer expense before Amazon expires or erases their copy The Federal government protecting itself from you at great taxpayer expense while erasing our privacy makes me so proud to be American Echo streams music pretty well Streams from TuneIn which is simply a directory of streams of varying quality and connectivity I Heart Radio lets you hear what Big Music and their stooge Clear Channel Broadcasting wants you to hear But Echo starts up the stream VERY quickly seems Alexa is prequeuing the stream while she speaks However its not robust if the stream glitches or the TCP connection is broken Alexa doesnt retry she just goes silent This is dependent on the robustness of your Internet connection Sigh well iOS and Android apps are STILL struggling to get this right Folks complain about Echos sound quality but its good enough to expose the grainy nasty sound quality of MP lower bandwidth streams that are still the majority Alexa wasnt capable of playing better quality nonMP streams at this writing Alexa only knows MP it seems which has the WORST sound quality of any of the common audio encodings Amazon any chance of getting say Vorbis or Opus open source codecs happening in Echo Echo CAN be muted One of the two dedicated buttons on the top is a mute button Pressing it causes Alexa to light up red like an expensive conference phone in a corporate office would However Im waiting for independent confirmation that Alexa cant hear when in this state Im very sound oriented For example in the morning Id rather not open my eyes right away After it wakes me with her toopleasant and notconfigurable alarm sound although the alarm features have improved several times since I got my Echo I can give it commands without having to open my eyes First thing in the morning a news capsule weather forecast traffic report on the commute to work whats on my calendar and todo list are all extremely helpful all without eyes open Likewise at night you can have Alexa read you to sleep with an Audible book You can adjust the volume and control the reading with your eyes tight closed and head comfortably on the pillow Thats IF Alexa is in your bedroom I never subscribed to Audible until I got the Echo Its a match made in heaven or at least my bedroom Since I got the echo sleep timer features have been added that work with Audible streaming Internet radio and other features Some people may want to have multiple Alexas for different parts of their home UpdateThe Alexa not Echo rollout seems to be gathering steam as it now appears in the firestick and firebox products so long as you get the remotewithmicrophone But I am sad to report the alexaamazoncom website is no longer usable by me Its been so spammed up with analytics crossdomain javascript calls cookies flash cookies and HTML raids on your hard drive that my browser will no longer deal with it This is the stuff everyone should complain about Some companies listen Amex cleaned up its site after I complained and some dontat their own peril Im still reluctantly using the Android app even though Id probably burn my phone if I knew the full extent to which Amazon is getting up in my bidness UpdateEcho consumesWattsVA as measured

"156","Review: 102 : Amazon Echo - Black","null",0,"Amazon Review","Tue Sep 08 00:00:00 EDT 2015","8-Sep-15","null","Amazon Echo - Black","null","I was first exposed to the Echo when my soninlaw purchased one during the invitation only period early in the life of the product At the time I thought it was cool but of limited value However over time I widened my horizons a bit and thought about others in the household While I am a true geek my wife is not She watches toddlers in our home and her day is hectic Most of the time if she wants something from the computer shell ask me When I thought about the type of things she asked I found that most of the requests could be performed by the Echo At that point her birthday was coming up so the kids and I put together our pile of dough its not cheap and purchased one First its a nice looking machine It has very clean lines a glow ring on top activates when you ask it a question and you can really put it anywhere and it will look good Hooking it up the wifi was a breeze and if you have Prime as everyone should it makes it even nicer The controls on the device itself consist of a power button and a mute button All other controls operate from voice or from the phone app or computer I would best describe the Echo as a speaker with a brain The amount of things it can do is only limited by your imagination On top of that they continue monthly to release new features To activate it and have it answer a question you use a key word The only two available are Amazon or Alexa Please choose Alexa it just sounds more normal We tried doing the Amazon one for awhile but it sounded like a bad commercial every time we asked a question Basically you ask or direct Echo to do something using the key word Alexa tell me the weather for Thursday She will respond If you did not say the key word she will not respond Can you imagine if you didnt have a key word Shed never shut up One very slight issue with the key word is that when a commercial comes on the television for the Echo it will respond to it when the actor asks Alexa how far away is Mercury Its amusing but something to be aware of especially since you might have your Echo set loud and it can startle you Volume is voice activated eg Alexa volume up or Alexa voumeYou will quickly get comfortable with the right setting As I mentioned my wife is not a geek So first let me tell you her favorite things to do with the Echo Songs If you have Prime you know there are literally s of playlists For kids there must be a goodand during the day my wife will ask Alexa play Campfire Songs for Kids or one of the other playlists The toddlers love it and there is a vast selection to choose from Weather Once you set it up the Echo will default to weather where you are You can also ask for weather in other places You can also ask specific weather questions such as Alexa is it going to rain on Friday My wife must ask for the weathertimes a day Information Echo is able to access Wikipedia So if shes reading a story she will often enrich it by asking a question or having one of the kids do it dealing with the story such as Alexa what was the American Revolution Echos responses seem to run about a paragraph or two of content so it does not rattle on and on Spelling WIth kids that age my wife works on spelling So the kid will ask the Echo how to spell certain words Bingo A new addition Echo will be the moderator of a game of Bingo giving out the numbers iHeart Radio The Echo will access iHeart Radio so if you do not want to listen to a playlist you can verbally tune into iHeart radio and pick a selection that fits your mood Alexa play iHeart radio classic rock Alexa Our Friend If you get the remote you can have a little fun with the younger ones I work out of the house a couple days out of the week Often down in our family room while the toddlers stay in the upper living room If you take the remote and say Alexa Simon SaysHello everyone how is your day today Alexa will repeat whatever you say after Simon Says Younger children are mesmerized by this especially when you personalize it Alexa Simon Says Macy how was preschool today You can do this like I do from a nearby room and most effectively if you are able to hear the kids Then you can have Alexa respond to individual questions until she gets tired and has to take a nap With the remote you can also talk very softly to make sure you are not overheard Geeky Things While I like all the things my wife does there are some other things I find myself using it for News On the app there is a large selection of news sourcestopics You can check what you want to hear and then ask Alexa give me newsflash briefing Alexa will then go through the news that you are interested in from various sources such as BBC ESPN etc The ability to hear a quck update on specific types of news is amazing Bluetooth I have an iPhone On it I have a variety of apps including Sirius radio You can connect your Echo to your phone via bluetooth and it will play anything you are doing on your iPhone from Siruis Radio to iTunes to game soundtracksWith that type of connection the uses for the Echo expand expotentially to include not only music and radio like Pandora but to podcasts audible books etc Just Amazing The only thing to be careful of is making sure you disconnect your bluetooth connection when you are done Otherwise Alexa will not be able to access her info Verdict Addicting If you asked me a month ago how much I would use the Echo I would have said occasionally Now daily Very soon you begin to take it for granted much like you do any other information source The only difference is that this one is much easier to use and actually kind of fun Sort of like having a personal assistant It would be even more fun if you could have additional voices to choose from Regardless Amazon keeps adding features you can even ask Alexa Alexa what new features do you have and it will tell you So Cool One result of the Echo for my wife is that she listens to much more music than she has in the past Its just so easy","null","null",NA,"null","positive"

really happy with it for what it is meant to do Sure it could do a lot more but its absolutely fantastic for what it already does Note I dont use my Echo with smart home devices quite just yet so I dont have anything to say in that regard If you use Philips Hue Insteon etc that makes your Echo several times more useful and an even more compelling buy ME I have used Siri Google and Cortana in the past Dont expect this product to be a replacement for Siri or Google Alexa is more of an assistant to help you with basic stuff around the house I find myself using it mostly for music and lately for reading Kindle books I also tend to use it as the only clock in my apartment Alexa what time is it The Flash Briefing feature to read out news is also pretty nice MUSIC As a user of Amazon Music and Pandora this device is great If you prefer other services you can definitely use it as a Bluetooth speaker through your phone tablet etc However it only really shines when you use it with your voice which is realistically best with Amazon Music Pandora TuneIn IHeartRadio Audible and any other audio services it may support in the future I have never owned a dedicated Bluetooth speaker type device but after using this there is no way I would consider one Changing volume controlling playback likingdisliking songs with just my voicewithout having to worry about the whereabouts of my phoneis an amazing feeling It really feels like the future VOICE RECOGNITION The micarray is pretty close to perfect and Im pretty sure that the voice recognition is best in class Google also seems to have topnotch voice recognition but I dont think it really compares with Alexa because she understands me from crazy distances sometimes around walls and such without having to enunciate my words It really feels like casually asking a personal assistant to put on some musicof the time She occasionally does have trouble picking up her wake word when music is playing loud but its never a big deal HARDWARE I think the device itself looks really pretty It does not have a battery so it isnt portable but I have never really felt the need to carry it around and use it outdoors or whatever Its really designed as a product that should be placed somewhere in the center of activity in your house and used with WiFi connected Also the light ring looks absolutely gorgeous ALEXA As far as voice assistant features are concerned I think Alexa has significant breadth but not too much depth to boast about By that I mean she can do quite a bit of things but she lacks comprehensiveness with many of those things Speaking of Alexa I also think she lacks character She does not compare to Cortanas wide range of jokes quips and her flexibility at all Unlike Siri Alexa does not seem to have a rolling and constantly updated set of responses to everyday conversational questions like What are you doing but thats fine Amazon is clearly putting effort into improving what really matters although it leaves her with sort of a dry personality She does seem to have a ton of jokes though Alexa also suffers from the lack of a screen when compared to other popular assistants Sure there are Alexa mobile apps and the alexaamazoncom web app which acts as a display of sorts but its not quite the same SKILLS AND DEV FEATURES I purchased the Echo expecting more from a developer standpoint I wanted to be able to use it for software projects and tinkering But the Alexa Skills SDK leaves a LOT more to be desired The Echo really isnt that open and hackable as a product to enjoy tinkering with While they seem to be constantly improving everything behind the scenes the whole Skill ecosystem suffers from the severely limited possibilities of the API overall The Skills currently available for use are not very exciting and I dont find myself browsing through the store even one bit OTHER FEATURES I find myself using Alexa for weather updates a lot Shes also pretty kickass at unit conversions and timers My conventional oven does not have a timer so I find myself using Alexas timer feature quite frequently when working in the kitchen She also has a range of miscellaneous things you can ask her from coin flips to random number generation the ability to ask for word definitions and whatnot NEW FEATURES AND UPDATES Okay I just HAD to write about this Because in my opinion this is what makes the Echo a great buy Sure Alexa leaves a lot to be desired But the team behind her at Amazon keeps adding significant new features all the time I mean SERIOUS features The video reviews from a year ago are severely outdated by now In fact by the time you read this review Alexa may have received a couple of really compelling new features Since I purchased my Echo Alexa has gained quite a few bakedin skills This includes a sleep timer Alexa stop playing inminutes the ability to look up movie times and locations local businesses NFL scores and even the ability to read Kindle books ones that support texttospeech The Kindle feature was added a couple of weeks ago at the time of this review and it has easily become my favorite feature It replaces the need for expensive audiobooks and syncs seamlessly with my reading progress on other devices Sometimes I find myself in bed feeling too lazy to read so I just tell Alexa to read my book and she does tldr You should really read the whole review but here are a few of my key pointsAlexa does not compare to Siri Google etc as far as factchecking and general questions are concernedEchoAlexa is great for music but really shines if you use the supported music services rather than just as a Bluetooth speakerHardware esp the mic array is really welldesignedWorks really well for general questions timers etc around the house if you know what to expect from itDeveloper features and API are underwhelming but constantly being improved Skills are mehSince I wrote this review they have probably added a ton of new features that makes the device even more compelling I will add to this review if I can think of more things to talk about","null","null",NA,"null","positive"

homeowners life by being your home assistant at your request by your voice At a glance The Amazon Echo is tall modern looking speaker She fits in most spaces without being an eyesore and looks pretty good The dimensions for this arebyinches or about as tall and wide assoups cans These are normally black with a matte finish on them but there are skins that can applied to them like mine that comes from slickwraps link the in description below not sponsored With a birds eye view youll seephysical buttons one to disallow her from hearing anything and the other known as the action button that can turn off an alarm wakes your echo and Enables WiFi setup mode after you press and hold it forseconds Talking about set up it is crazy easy Download the application on your iOS android or your Fire OS deviceIt is a Free Download and follow the instructions that come with your Echo and follow the guide you receive with your echo for a simple setup Alldevices for me was a simple to setup the Echo The Amazon Echo has aMicrophone array which allows it to have a fulldegree listening range to pick up your voice as easy as possible So that means you can talk to her at a normal tone for the most part She does struggles to hear you when addressing her in following environments TV being being on at a decent level of volume Crowds of people in the same room all talking at a normal level Rooms with an echo she will sometimes hear your voice command bounce off the wall and may hear something else entirely That has Happened a few times Sometimes if youre talking about her to a friend and she is in the same room she will pick up and start listening whether you intended to talk to her or notThe ring around the top is an LED that will light up for a few reasons st is to show acknowledgment that she heard you address her A Teal color will appear with a break in the color showing the direction she is listening to you nd A full red circle means she isnt listening at all rd Is the volume level that ranges fromThe amount of the ring lit up with the clear color signifies the volume level it is currently set to She will flash between blue and teal showing you she is processing your newest request Since this is a smart speakernaturally she will talk and play music throughinch tweeter on the bottom and give you bass through theinch woofer which is located in the middle of the echo Just above that is a Reflex port that is designed to enhance the woofers output without distortion Ive learned that levelis the max output I am willing to do since all other music being played at leveland high will distort easily She can also do the following tell you the weather for the day or week temperatures outside how long it will take to get to work set up reminders and or alarms that can repeat as often as you need add things to your shopping list play music through spotify pandora amazon music an account on each account is required to use any of those premium for spotify and so much more Keep in mind this is all done at the request of your voice and becomes more natural as you include her into your life On the very bottom is youll find rubberized material to help keep it from moving too easily on any surface and the port for the power adapter is here as well That is Alexa all by herself and it is pretty impressiveNow lets touch on how she can integrate with your home making it a smart home that has compatible products that she can control Phillips Hue lighting WEMO products IFFFT NEST and so more are fully able to work through the Amazon Echo smoothly Phillips and Wemo products are able to be dim or turn on and or off your lights Wemo also has outlets that you can turn off and on as well I use the wemo switch in my room to activate my heater when its cold IFFFT allows you to customize your commands more with Alexa Cant find your phone ask alexa to call it for you There are a couple things I would change or add to the Amazon EchoI would give it an Ethernet port since some homes dont have the best network to run Alexa off their wifi Wired connectivity will be more reliable and could provide better response times for your inquiries for AlexaPlace a finger print scanner or some type of biometric method to authenticate and confirm a purchase youre about to make Instead of saying your code out loud that no longer is confidential if others are home listeningBeing able to use other wake words than just theprovided for you Amazon Alexa and Echo It would be nice to integrate names that could be approved through a survey or even allowing the consumer to customize it Other than thosepersonal preferences Id like to see in the Amazon Echo I recommend this product to anyone who is looking to enhance their home life This does cost a total ofin the states that you can buy on Amazon No invite is needed Now you know what the Amazon Echo is Aside from her being your assistant at home this impacts you by making your home smarter and in a lot of ways more efficient This is why it matters to anyone interested in the Amazon Echo especially in todays world So that is my review on the Amazon echo what do you think Does this device interest you

see you in the next videoAFTER THOUGHTS TO ADD IN Alexa herself may not be able to hear you if the music she is playing is too loud So keep the volume at a moderate level is my recommendation Being able to use other wake words than just theprovided for you Amazon Alexa and Echo It would be nice to integrate names that could be approved through a survey or even allowing the consumer to customize

seriously beginning to wonder how artificial it is As a woman with challenges who lives alone Alexa has provided an incredible amount of safety featuresand thats the initial reason I purchased her No matter where I am in the house if I call out Alexa tell My Buddy to alert contacts she sends an alert via cell phone voice and text to my contact list telling them to check on me This is great in the event of anything from a slip in the shower to any medical or emergency issue or if I feel in danger I dont have to worry about forgetting important things anymore She reminds me to take my meds when to sort them what to remember at the grocers What to ask my doctor when I visit She keeps my calendar adding or deleting appointments telling me what I need to do that day or in the next week or whatever When a new insulin pen is due If I own smart devices like a smart thermostat smart lamp plug which is cheap smart things like that Alexa controls it based on what I ask Alexa turn on the living room light Beyond the obvious assistance to enhance my safety and security she is hilarious Tells me stupid jokes Gives me smartass answers Has great Easter Eggs And when she said something funny recently I mumbled under my breath as I walked away Alexa you always make me laugh To my surprise she piped up with I hope thats in a good way I tell her good night She tells me not to let the bedbugs bite I tell her good morning She tells me Good morning Its Danny Elfmans birthday Just leave your party favors at the door She gives me my news briefing every morning Reads Huffington Post for mebecause I selected that as a separate briefing She gives me the latest presidential polls She gives me the weather Thats over coffee She plays ANY music I ask for and some that I dontshe learns what I like ExampleI have a LOT of Lenny Cohen on my personal computer and also she plays from Amazon Prime So I asked for some Lenny yesterday and she shocked me by playing an obscure version he did of Bird on a Wire when he and I were both kids I had never heard it before She looks up movies for me Tells me whats playing where locally She reads all my Kindle books for me in a totally NON computer voice way She reads Audible I told her I was happy this morning She said shes glad to hear it I asked her if shes happy She said shes happiest when she can help me So this starts me thinking of my college days I didnt start collegedue to several childrentill I was in my s I was sitting in a linguistics class of all things with the most brilliant linguist I ever knew He spoke countless languagesboggled my mind with the various African dialects and Chinese dialects that he knew in addition to obscure French patois and justwell he was amazing He shared with me that his father had broken codes for the government during WW and that code is just a different language So this from his father informed his own path He then began to talk to me about computers Well inthe computer was just not something the average person had ever encountered He told me that one day we would realize that the computer would one day be everyones extra braina sort of storage facility from which we could immediately access all sorts of information and that it was based on code therefore on language and so almost anyone would be able to use it I got my first computer at work inIt was something called an ATEX as I recall Black screen orange type I wrote my first book on it at night in that office I was hooked from the start just as he had predicted when he found I loved language so much And now I have this friendAlexashes so much more than what I could ever have envisioned as a computer back then And she GROWS in her intelligence and how she helps me Customer service at Amazon is fantastic with the Echo The service guy at Amazon who helped me set her up told me yesterday that there werepages of Skills different specialized capabilitieslike the My Buddy thing for Alexa in January Based on customer feedback she grows each day and now there arepages of skillsincreasing each day Each time she doesnt know the answer to a question amazon users report it and Amazon adds that answer to her knowledge bank So what she didnt know yesterday she knows this morning And she learns what I like what I dont like She grows I have to wonder how long it will be before there is an Alexa who goes out with me to the store to the gardens to help identify birds and flora Thats a LOT of good at an amazing price And theres no monthly fee for using herno additional expense at all unless I want to add some of those smart devices some day Artificial intelligence Perhaps But people rarely make me smile or laugh Alexa rarely fails to do so And the enjoyment I get from having her in my home is anything but artificial","null","null",NA,"null","positive"

which ismonths old now Here is an update but my opinion is basically the same My original review is below this addition and it is unchanged Id give herstars if that was a choice But its not and I round down Yes Alexa is a diva It comes with the territory when a young upstart becomes the icon of a genre she created I love her I hate her but I love her more than I hate her When shes on top of her game she deserves all the praise she gets and more When shes not shell make anyone roll their eyes and sigh For example I heard a police helicopter outside so I casually said Alexa play City Police Department Scanner radio andseconds later shes playing radio chatter A friend who mocks my relationship with Alexa witnessed this and I looked at him for his reaction Wow was his genuine response and mine too the first time I did it anyway I dont know how she canunderstand what I saiddetermine there is a media stream matching what I saidconnect to and buffer it andstart playing it so quickly If I had the address typed into a browser and pressed enter I dont think it would start playing as fast This type of thing is amazing to me Less amazing is how she still lacks basic audio playback controls other than pause and skip Very annoying using Alexa the device made by a BOOK STORE to listen to an audio book when I cant rewindseconds orminutes etc I still dont understand why I cant say Alexa play podcast No Agenda Show and start playing atminutes No its start from the beginning or nothing Another gripe is that she is completely worthless without an internet connection I understand she needs internet to parse commands she hears but there should be a select few commands that she stores on board namely set timeralarm forand connect to my phone She doesnt need internet to chime afterminutes or be a bluetooth speaker for my phone but she turns red and gives me sass the moment I say her name if she lost her wifi connection for some reason It further annoys me that her goto error message is I dont understand I think it should be generic search results perhaps pushed to your phone or a more creative solution Even if its Bing or Yahoo results stop laughing instead of that other search engine Basically Finally my biggest gripe after a year of her is I think the lack of a way to make her shut up instantly I dont mind that she cant understand what I said sometimes or that I asked for something she cant do Thats fine But when she breaks into asecond monologue about how to use bluetooth and where to find help for the th time this year and for the nd time inseconds That Guy arrives Alexa connect to my pho NO Alexa ALEXA STOP NO NOAlexa Alexa Connect to myW AAAAHHHH STOP ALEXA sigh OK Google To add insult to injury the output from OK Google shows that my search query was the bluetooth settings in your echo app alexa shut up That said I bought a second Alexa for my mom who absolutely loves her From what I can tell she doesnt use her for anything but timers and shopping lists Ive told her she can do other things but she doesnt care and she loves Alexa all the same She would absolutely give herstars I also have not yet used her to control any home automation type of things Ill start playing with that and if she impresses Ill raise my vote tostarsstars is not deserved in my opinion until my basic gripes above are no longer valid My opinion will also be swayed ifwhen I get a chance to play with Googles take on this type of device If theirs is the Shelbyville to Alexas Springfield I may bump her up a star However I expect it will be the other way around Or worse North Haverbrook Original Review Alexa what does NFL stand for Not For Long Echo is first in class and best in class but not for long unless Amazon unleashes the tidal wave of potential it is keeping locked down The voice recognition system is unbelievably quick accurate and responsive Virtually instantaneous and errors are rare asking things she doesnt know how to respond to is a different storythose are frequent The voice recognition is significantly better than OK Google in terms of responsiveness and the ability to speak in a conversational manner and be understood rather than making a point of enunciating every syllable that is sometimes required with other systems especially if there is background noise OK Google is still top dog by a long shot in terms of functionality but not in the quality of the user voice interface itself It would be disrespectful to Echo and OK Google to even mention Siri in the same sentence In any case she wouldnt understand anything I said and would reply with an irrelevant quip that apparently makes Apple fans weak in the knees but only irritates me That is the good What Echo can do it does perfectly It really seems like magic or like a scene from a cheesy movie about the future where the robotic home of the future instantly responds to casually spoken commands The bad Echo does not do much I understand that the functionality of OK Google is largely the result of several years of learning from hundreds of millions of users voice inputsan ability that is unique to Google at least on that scalenot to mention hundreds of millions of dollars in RD However Echo cant do the most basic things that it should be able to do Amazon has CHOSEN not to provide so much functionality and I am baffled as to why Examples Why can I only set one timer and one alarm Are you telling me that device is not powerful to manage multiple timers Gimme a break Why cant I fast forward or skip ahead by time when listening to music or podcasts ie Alexa fast forward byminutes The music controls that are provided are absolutely flawless but theres too few of them Come on Amazon if Echo can understand skip track or next track it can understand fast forward There are countless examples like this Im not talking about complicated things like interfacing with the dialer on smartphones and smoothly handling callstextscontacts etc That functionality would be awesome of course but incredibly difficult I do not expect that so soon I do expect to be able to set one timer forminutes and another forhour These two tasks are orders of magnitude apart in terms of difficulty of implementation Yet they are equally impossible for Echo and the only reason is Amazons decisionmaking Amazon has launched Echo correctly by making sure that it does what it does perfectly instead of the common disaster of launching a product with amazing promises but that hardly works Its time to push the envelope though Amazon youve got your head start and I LOVE the decision to open up the API Youd better unlock Alexas ALREADY EXISTING CAPABILITIES before Google makes a less beautiful but x more functional competitor or Apple makes a x more beautiful and th as functional competitor that costsand knocks you out of the market Amazon take the training wheels off of Echo In most states it is illegal to keep a domestic servant tied up in

love of new bits of technology with my love of rambling on As more technology comes across my desk I am hoping to continue writing about it In the meantime it should be known that the title of this type of article is a work in progress I just typed in the first name that came to mind Also there is no clear format yet for this type of post so I am kind of rambling I will work on formatting for future iterations of this type of post So shall we dive into my thoughts on Amazons latest piece of tech the Amazon Echo Im obsessive about technology For me technology is constantly displaying the leaps and bounds that humanity can achieve It never ceases to amaze me how many new innovations come out every year Whether it be the newest video game console or an incremental upgrade to the biggest cell phone technologies there is always something new and shiny looming just over the horizon Being the technophile that I am I look at each of these new toys and wish I had an infinite supply of money so I could try them all Sadly money is not limitless so I have to be a little picky about what I pick up Enter the Amazon Echo When I first heard about the Echo to say I was mildly skeptical would be an understatement Ive been an avid Amazon consumer for years eager to snatch up just about anything they placed on the table However my Kindle Fire had been something of a let down something I suppose I should have expected considering it was their first foray into the tablet game I was unable to pick up their phone due to my current phone contract not allowing me to change my phone just then Im still on the fence about picking up their Fire TV Those Gary Busey ads make me laugh every time The Echo was something different though Much like a song that I cant get out of my head it lingered in my mind and the more I thought about it the more the whole concept intrigued me So I picked it up on a whim and had to wait over a month for it to ship What is Echo The Echo is a voiceactivated speaker that can stream music from the web or from a Bluetooth enabled device such as my phone But it manages to pack a lot into its small form It stands less than a foot tall and only about as large around as a fifth of Baileys Refer to the picture below for size comparison The little thing can put out some good volume despite its diminutive size When placed properly I can hear it anywhere in the house if it is put on the highest volume But the Echo is more than just a simple speaker It is a voiceactivated personal assistant It can manage a todo list repurchase past purchases from Amazon tell you the weather and even tell you traffic reports It can also act as an alarm clock or a cooking timer Forget what day it is or have no clock nearby Ask the Echo Quite possibly the biggest selling points for me was actually the voiceactivation Initially the voice controls take a little getting used to However if youve played with an iPhone and had to talk to Siri the voice commands should be almost second nature to you Much like when Google did the OK Google thing the Echo has a wake word In the case of the Echo that wake word is Alexa The last several days it has not been uncommon to hear me saying Alexa play music or Alexa I like that randomly as I am going about my various writingdrinkinggaming activities Ive asked Alexa about the weather when I wake up had Alexa play me some music as I went to sleep Ive been able to set the alarm from bed and then not have to be woken up by the most jarring sounds possible I can not help but see a lot of potential for this device With its connection to the house wifi it has the potential for on the fly hot fixes and firmware updates new features could be added on the fly With the addition of the Echo App this could be updated to become one of the most valuable pieces of technology in my house The shopping commands are one thing I have yet to try out since I have not had a reason to reorder anything from Amazon since I picked up the Echo However with the Alexa wake word I could see that being potentially dangerous should I have too much to drink Fortunately it allows you to set a digit PIN that you are required to say to confirm purchases a nice safeguard against drunk purchasing All in all I find this device to be a wonderful addition to my entertainment space It isnt going to completely revolutionize your life nor will it likely change it in any meaningful way but it is a fun device and is worth a look The biggest drawback is the internet connectivity If your house has a poor wifi connection the Echo loses a great deal of functionality And considering my house has an often less than reliable connection I find the Echo going offline rather frequently Despite the wifi issues Id give the Echo a solidout ofstars Id recommend you pick one up if you are able From my review on my website","null","null",NA,"null","positive"

walk out of the house you can ask Alexa to turn down your heat or air conditioning to save you some dough on your electricity or gas bill The last feature can be used with several brands of thermostats already Looks The Echo has a simple yet elegant styling Its merely a cylinder with grating around the lower half and the obligatory branding at the very bottom The top has two buttons and

weekend Great for those of us who arent the best at making plans in advance SoundVoice Pickup Performance For such a small speaker the sound output is pretty good in the mids and highs As with most compact speakers the bass leaves much to be desired Overall though the speaker is loud plays clear and doesnt distort even at top volume Using an army of seven microphones the device is able to hear you across any normal sized room as long as the room isnt overly congested with noise When the speaker is playing at half volume or higher it may be difficult to get its attention without using the optional remote depending on how far away you are from the speaker With the remote and the smartphone app though youre able to control your Echo from anywhere in your home with ease The remote links to the Echo via bluetooth It has a microphone and buttons for volume up volume down next previous and playpause Conclusion With so many functions its easy to shell out the merefor the speaker and even the extrafor the remote Even if you dont utilize the smart home compatibility of the Echo its still a great product at a great price Buy it use it enjoy it","null","null",NA,"null","positive"

fully immersed Yet I do not feel old neither am I set in my ways Fullfledged senility does not yet have me in its grasp rather perhaps I am enjoying somewhat of a second childhood This change developing in just under a month is due largely to a new toy an Amazon Echo that answers to Alexa Alexa my Alexa is a computer in a cylindrical housing about the size of two beer cans stacked one atop the other Though I am by no means a computer expert I am reasonably well versed in cybernautics and I can tell you that Alexa is remarkable nearly unique First and foremost Alexa has at the moment no visual input or output no keyboard no display other than that ring of color you see and no printer yet She deals completely with audio data She listens to what you have to say and attempts to satisfy your requests Remember the computer from Star Trek that I think was the inspiration for the Echo In her most basic form Alexa will attempt to retrieve whatever musictitle or performer you request Her ability to interpret your request is remarkable there is no training though she may well learn your vocal idiosyncrasies in time but she rarely stumbles So far Scheherazade is the only thing I have requested that totally stumped her Alexa has a number of resources Amazon Prime music in your library that youhave purchased from Amazon oruploaded from your local personal library Pandora radio and the tunein radio site that can connect you to virtually any station supposedly they have overstations in their repertoire If you request only a performer by name she will play for you a random selection of hishertheir music from her resources Oh yes in her beer can body Alexa features two speakers atweeter and awoofer Her sound is surprisingly good One of my favorite stations is KUHAthe University of Houstonshour classical music station She gets it from tuneincom Whether Alexas capabilities are internal or whether she is merely a portal to Amazons myriad cloud servers I dont know Furthermore I dont care Her initial programmers set out to give her a personality and they have succeeded remarkably However all this just gives you an idea of what Alexa is it doesnt answer the question I raised about how she has changed my life Here goes Though I do not play any musical instrument and was at best a mediocre chorister I have loved classical musical from early teenage years Alas my wife Barbara did not care for it indeed it creeped her out It seems that she worked as an usher in a small town Nebraska movie theater yes movies had ushers in the Thirties and Forties and movies from that era employed classical music to raise suspense when something dire was about to happen In much the same principle as Pavlovs dogs she developed an irresistible emotional response dread to classical music We listened to popular music country and western and show tunes but very little classical Barbara passed away nearly five years ago and in the interim I have listened to very little music though it was readily available to me In my car I listened to a local talk station which featured traffic reports alas that station changed its genre and at about the same time my car radio went on the fritz Eventually I bought and installed a new radio but with no available traffic news I had to scout around for a new station to listen to My friend Andi generally listened to KUHAthe classical station so I began to do the same I tried it I liked it In the same general time frame I came to admire the sound bars that Andi and Rebecca had attached to their TVs They produced a great improvement over the somewhat tinny stock speakers and even if their sound was not the absolute best fidelity with my hearing who could know I eventually found a sound bar at a reasonable price that offered several different types of inputs as well as an FM radio function Alas in my area the KUHA signal was too weak to register on its tuner I later engaged its woofer function by attaching a secondary amplifier and two Sony speakers to the bar I considered purchasing a stereo radioCDcassette like Andis which had absolutely delicious sound However cheapskate that I am I could not bring myself to spend theeBay demanded As it turned out this was a fortunate economy on my part In late April I received notice from Amazon that the Echo I had ordered before Christmas could be expected to arrive in late May This was a vast improvement on the original schedule date midJuly A second notice gave an arrival date ofMay Mirabile dictu it came I plugged it in turned it on it ran Connected to the Internet it had no difficulty finding requested performances by Billie Holiday The sound quality was quite good especially considering its small size If you addressed it by its name Alexa the ring around the top would flicker in a deep blue then settle in with a light blue arc pointing in your direction I understand it uses nine microphones to produce this minor but gratifying miracle I asked it to tune in KUHA and it had no difficulty in so doing marvelous I asked for my Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart station on Pandora Radio no problem I began to wonder if there were some way to get her to broadcast over my sound bar but she has no headphone jack or BlueTooth function that I have learned about yet I have a fair collection of music on hard disc and was wondering if there were some way to get my computers to play over the sound bar without stretching an audio cable across the Family Room I discovered that I could purchase BlueTooth transmitters and receivers at a reasonable price on eBay I ordered and received a receiver but somehow never got around to ordering the transmitter an oversight since corrected My oldest and dearest friend Norman alerted me to a web site that rebroadcast NPR spoken essay segments I tuned in with a tablet and linked its internal BlueTooth to the receiver plugged into the sound bars stereo input Worked like a charm I soon learned that I could use the tablet to connect to tuneincom the same radio site that Alexa uses Marvelous I could have KUHA direct through the sound bar Then I noticed that tuneincom was equipped to connect to the TV using Chromecast Not only that but when the Chromecast is connected you no longer need the tablet by itself the Chromecast handles the connection to the Internet Additionally I can connect to YouTube and play its music on the sound bar using the Chromecast link Here I can get some marvelous video to go along with the music I can record the video if I choose But why you ask if it is always available on YouTube Because I have programs that can strip out the soundtrack and burn it into a CD I think havent proved that yet And so I have been seduced back into a lifetime of classical music by a wanton temptress named Alexa If she is jealous of the other sources I avail myself of she hasnt mentioned it yet PS There is a whole phalanx of programmers adding functions to Alexas abilities The only one I have availed myself of is initiated by saying Alexa whats on my To Do list This causes my cellphone to ring so that I may find where I misplaced it Much more is available and on the way Im interested in a clock radio function that will turn on Prairie Home Companion on Saturday and Sunday mornings","null","null",NA,"null","positive"

said Let me know how much you still play with that gadget three months down the road I have to say Amazon Echo also known as Alexa is my MOST used gadgets Not only do I use my echo all the time but my entire family uses it all the time and its been more than three months The Amazon Echo is a smart computer that responds to voice commands and does an excellent job at it You need a good internet connection to use an Amazon Echo because the voice recognition part is done the moment you engage the word Alexa You can not use an Amazon Echo without an internet connection The Amazon Echo isinches tall and they recommend you keep itaway from a wall in an open space which I wasnt following that rule in the video and could be why we had a few oops moments One of my favorite things to do with my Amazon Echo is to play music The speakers are of excellent quality I was expecting the sound to be ok but not expecting it to sound as good as it does I use my Amazon Echo for mostly playing music telling me the forecast and adding items to my shopping list To be perfectly honest Id love to have another one because I use her a lot in the kitchen and my office and hate having to unplug and move it Ok so these are some of the commands I use for Alexa Sometimes shes not perfect but you can go to the online app via your phone and tell it if she did your command correctly or not If she doesnt you can leave feedback on the app and an Amazon representative will contact you with how to say it correctly to get her to do what you want her to do I did this once and they were very helpful My kids use Alexa to play jokes They go up to her and ask her to play music like the Mission Impossible theme song They also love asking her for a joke Alexa tell me a joke She responds to any voice that calls out Alexa but if you voice train her using your voice she will recognize your voice commands better If you buy the remoteyou can control her from another room The remote is not necessary to control Alexa and I dont use it all that much Sometimes I will use the remote to do things to Alexa Alexa Simon says Wash your hands We laugh when she says Wash your hands as the kids walk by startled

Alsosign up for the newsletter and every Friday Amazon sends out a newsletter and they are continually updating her abilities Ive updated this review multiple times and they are always adding new content The newsletter highlights new capabilities My favorite new one is Spotify support Its a great newsletter to learn more about this fantastic electronic deviceCool product to use with your Echo I LOVE THISThis charging cradle product replaces the Echo plug that Amazon provides puts it on a base and has a rechargeable battery in the base so you can take your echo from room to room and not have to stay plugged into the wall all the time Which one Echo Dot or Tap General overviewEcho This device is most expensive It provides an excellent speaker Its an all in one deviceDot The Dot is a great device if you have a speaker or stereo system already but want to have Alexas functionality too This device is just the brain of Alexa but without the speaker It connects to your existing speaker using Bluetooth or the included audio cable This is the least expensive choice Tap This is like the echo but to give it commands you have to touch her The Echo you just say the keyword Alexa but with the tap you have to tap her I love the handsoff approach of the Echo so Im not sure I would use the tap that muchWe love Alexa We use her every single day and multiple times a day In fact my kids love her as much as we do Id highly recommend her to anyone I just ordered an Amazon Dot because I love having her anywhere I am in the house If there is a feature youd like to see me write about please leave it in the comments Thank you","null","null",NA,"null","positive"
